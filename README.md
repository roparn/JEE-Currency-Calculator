This is my currency calculator demo project, written in Java and using JEE technologies and components such as Servlet, JSP, JSTL and other web technologies like CSS, Javascript (using jQuery framework) and AJAX (yet to be implemented). Using MVC and object-oriented programming.

Note: solution is lacking some refinements, but is functional.
TODO:
 * Implement maven build automation
 * Refine backend currency xml file parsing
 * Add functionality to load and parse custom (user supplied) xml currency files
 * Implement AJAX
